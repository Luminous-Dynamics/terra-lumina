# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Terra Lumina (Luminous Dynamics), we take security seriously. We appreciate the security community's efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities and work with us to protect our users.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report security vulnerabilities to:
- **Email**: security@luminousdynamics.org
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports in a timely manner:

1. **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
2. **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
3. **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on severity, typically 30-90 days

### Our Commitment

When you report a security vulnerability, we commit to:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- Provide regular updates on our progress
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- Credit you for the discovery (if you wish) when we disclose the vulnerability
- Not pursue legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission
- Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond the minimal testing required to prove it exists
- Report vulnerabilities promptly
- Keep vulnerability details confidential until we've resolved the issue

Researchers who follow these guidelines will not face legal action from us for their security research.

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- **terra.luminousdynamics.org** (main website)
- **Official GitHub repositories** (github.com/Luminous-Dynamics)
- **Future platform services** (Terra Atlas, when launched)

### Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks against Luminous Dynamics facilities
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks
- Spam or social media account takeovers
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services we don't control

However, if you discover something concerning even if it's out of scope, please let us know.

### Security Best Practices We Follow

- **HTTPS Everywhere**: All connections encrypted with TLS
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizing all user inputs
- **Secure Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
