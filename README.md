# Terra Lumina

> Building energy-abundant communities through democratic investment in renewable infrastructure

## Overview

Terra Lumina is a Pre-Seed stage platform democratizing energy infrastructure investment. We're building the technology that connects investors of all sizes to renewable energy projects worldwide, starting with untapped hydroelectric resources and expanding to geothermal, solar, and wind opportunities.

## Project Status

- **Stage**: Pre-Seed
- **Funding Target**: $750K-1.5M
- **Timeline to Series A**: 18-24 months
- **Current Focus**: Platform development and pilot project pipeline

## Vision

We're not raising $650M to build one city. We're raising $750K to build the platform that enables thousands of community-owned energy projects worldwide.

### The Opportunity

- **87,000** untapped dams in US alone
- **$60B** immediate hydroelectric retrofit opportunity
- **4M+** global renewable sites identified
- **11-14%** target IRR for investors

## Platform Model

1. **Terra Atlas**: Digital investment platform connecting investors to projects
2. **Project Discovery**: AI-powered identification of renewable opportunities
3. **Community Investment**: Enable investments from $10 to $10M
4. **Regenerative Exit**: 7-year path to community ownership
