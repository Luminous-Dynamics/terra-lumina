## About Terra Lumina

### What is Terra Lumina?

Terra Lumina is an investment platform that democratizes access to renewable energy infrastructure projects. We connect investors of all sizes with vetted renewable energy opportunities worldwide, enabling investments from $100 to $10M.

### What does "democratizing energy investment" mean?

Traditionally, energy infrastructure investments require $10M+ minimums, locking out 99% of potential investors. We're making these opportunities accessible to everyone, from individual investors to institutions, with transparent terms and positive environmental impact.

### What stage are you at?

We're currently in **Pre-Seed stage**, raising $750K-1.5M to build our platform MVP and launch pilot projects. We're targeting Series A in 18-24 months.

### Who is behind Terra Lumina?

Terra Lumina is a project of **Luminous Dynamics**, a consciousness-first technology collective. Our founder Tristan Stoltz brings vision and strategy, and we're actively hiring CTO, Head of Projects, and Head of Community with Pre-Seed funds.

### What's your mission?

To democratize energy infrastructure investment, accelerate the renewable energy transition, and enable community ownership of energy assets. We believe energy abundance should benefit everyone, not just institutional investors.

## The Investment Opportunity

### How much are you raising?

**Pre-Seed Round**: $750K - $1.5M
**Structure**: SAFE or Convertible Note
**Discount**: 20-30% on Series A
**Minimum**: $25K per investor
**Timeline**: Closing Q1 2025

### What's the valuation?

Pre-money valuation is $3-6M, negotiable based on terms and investor value-add.

### Why should I invest now vs. waiting for Series A?

Pre-Seed investors get:
- 20-30% discount on Series A valuation
- Earlier entry at lower valuation
- More influence on platform direction
- Pro-rata rights (negotiable)
- First access to platform features

By Series A (18-24 months), we'll have proven traction, higher valuation, and more competition for allocation.

### What are you using the funds for?

- **30%** Platform Development ($300K)
- **22.5%** Legal/Regulatory ($225K)
- **30%** Team Building ($300K)
- **15%** Marketing/Community ($150K)
- **2.5%** Operations & Reserve ($150-375K)

See detailed budget breakdown in our executive summary.

### What's the expected timeline to Series A?

18-24 months, targeting $7-15M Series A round once we hit key metrics:
- $10M+ platform investment volume
- 100+ active investors
- 20+ funded projects
- $750K annual platform revenue

### Can I invest less than $25K?

For Pre-Seed, $25K is our minimum due to legal and administrative costs. However, once our platform launches (Q3 2025), individual project investments will start at $100.

### What's the investment process?

1. **Initial Call** (30 min) - Learn about opportunity
2. **Data Room Access** - Review detailed materials
3. **Due Diligence** (2-3 weeks) - Ask questions, meet team
4. **Term Sheet** - Review and negotiate terms
5. **Legal Docs** - Sign investment agreements

## Platform & Technology

### How does the Terra Atlas platform work?

Terra Atlas is a web and mobile platform where:
1. **Project Developers** list vetted renewable energy projects
2. **Investors** browse, evaluate, and invest in projects
3. **We Handle** legal docs, payments, reporting, compliance
4. **Everyone Wins** - Developers get funding, investors get returns + impact

### What types of projects will you list?

**Phase 1** (Year 1): Hydroelectric retrofits (proven technology, clear ROI)
**Phase 2** (Year 2): Solar, wind, battery storage
**Phase 3** (Year 3+): Geothermal, tidal, emerging technologies

We focus on proven technologies with predictable returns initially, expanding as we prove the model.

### How do you vet projects?

Multi-stage due diligence:
1. **Technical Review** - Engineering feasibility, permits, timeline
2. **Financial Model** - Revenue projections, costs, IRR calculations
3. **Legal Review** - Ownership, contracts, regulatory compliance
4. **Environmental** - Impact assessment, sustainability metrics
5. **Third-Party Validation** - Independent technical and financial audits

Only projects passing all stages get listed.

### What makes your platform different from crowdfunding sites?

| Feature | Terra Lumina | Typical Crowdfunding |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Focus | Energy infrastructure only | General projects |
| Vetting | Multi-stage technical/financial | Basic screening |
| Returns | 11-14% target IRR | Variable or zero |
| Minimums | $100 - accessible | Often $1000+ |
| Exit | Secondary market planned | Usually illiquid |
| Impact | Measurable carbon reduction | Varies |

### Is the platform built yet?

Platform architecture is designed. Development begins immediately upon Pre-Seed funding. MVP launches Month 3 post-funding. We're not claiming it's built - transparency is core to our values.

### What technology stack will you use?

Modern, proven technologies:
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js (web), React Native (mobile)
- **Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Payments**: Stripe, Plaid integration
- **Security**: SOC 2 compliance path, encryption, multi-factor auth
- **Hosting**: AWS or Google Cloud (scalable, secure)

### Will there be a mobile app?

Yes! Web platform launches first (Month 3), mobile apps (iOS/Android) in beta by Month 9.

## Market & Competition

### How big is the market opportunity?

- **Global renewable energy investment**: $1.5 trillion annually
- **Crowdfunding market**: $1.2 billion and growing 16% annually
- **Impact investing**: $715 billion AUM, growing rapidly
- **Our initial focus** (hydroelectric retrofits): $60 billion opportunity

### Who are your competitors?

Direct competitors are limited:
- **Mosaic**: Solar-only, $25K minimum, US-focused
- **Wunder Capital**: Commercial solar, $100K minimum
- **Institutional funds**: Various, but $10M+ minimums

**Our differentiation**: Lower minimums, all renewable types, global reach, community ownership path.

### What about big players entering the space?

Possible, but we have first-mover advantage in this specific niche. Plus:
- Mission-driven focus attracts different investors
- Community-first approach builds loyalty
- Specialized expertise in energy due diligence
- Potential acquisition target if we execute well

### Why hasn't someone done this already?

They have - partially. But:
- Regulatory complexity deterred many
- Tech wasn't ready until recently (APIs, payment infrastructure)
- Climate urgency creating new demand
- Recent SEC crowdfunding rule expansions enabling new models

Perfect timing + right team + clear need = our opportunity.

## Financials & Returns

### What returns can investors expect?

**Platform Investment (Pre-Seed)**:
- Target IRR: Not specified (equity/SAFE)
- Exit timeline: 5-7 years
- Exit options: IPO, acquisition, or dividend model

**Project Investments** (once platform launches):
- Target IRR: 11-14% on renewable projects
- Hold period: Typically 5-10 years
- Distributions: Quarterly or annual, depending on project

### How will you make money?

**Revenue Streams**:
1. **Transaction Fees**: 2-3% on investments
2. **Success Fees**: Origination fees from project developers
3. **SaaS Subscriptions**: Premium features for active investors
4. **Data Services**: Market intelligence and analytics

**Projections**:
- Year 1: $1.25M revenue (not profitable)
- Year 2: $6.25M revenue (approaching breakeven)
- Year 3: $25M revenue (profitable)

### When do you expect to be profitable?

**Platform-level profitability**: Year 2-3, depending on growth rate.

We're building a marketplace - the key is achieving critical mass. Once we hit $100M+ annual volume, margins improve significantly due to platform leverage.

### What's your path to $1B valuation?

**Conservative Path**:
- Year 3: $1B platform volume × 2.5% fees = $25M revenue
- At 3-5x revenue multiple = $75-125M valuation

**Optimistic Path**:
- Year 5: $5B platform volume × 3% fees = $150M revenue
- At 5-7x revenue multiple = $750M - $1B+ valuation

Comparable: LendingClub hit $9B valuation with similar marketplace model.

## Legal & Compliance

### What legal structure are you?

Currently forming. Likely **Delaware C-Corp** for venture funding compatibility, though exploring LLC structures for flexibility.

### Are you SEC registered?

Not yet required at Pre-Seed stage with private placements. Once platform launches, we'll register as needed based on:
- Funding portal (if using Reg CF)
- Broker-dealer (if applicable)
- RIA (if providing investment advice)

Working with specialized securities counsel on compliance path.

### What about state securities laws?

We'll comply with all applicable state (Blue Sky) laws. This is complex but manageable:
- Some states require registration
- Some states have exemptions
- Some projects may be state-specific initially

### How do you protect investor funds?

**For Project Investors** (once platform launches):
- Tax treatment depends on structure (equity, debt, etc.)
- Many renewable projects offer tax credits
- We'll provide annual tax documents
- Recommend consulting your tax advisor

### Is this a security offering?

Yes. Pre-Seed round is a private placement to accredited investors only. Platform project investments will also be securities, offered in compliance with applicable regulations (Reg D, Reg CF, or Reg A+).

## Risks & Challenges

### What are the main risks?

**Platform Risks**:
1. **Regulatory**: Securities laws complex, could delay launch
2. **Market**: Investor appetite uncertain until proven
3. **Technology**: Platform development could face delays
4. **Competition**: Larger players could enter space
5. **Team**: Key hire challenges or turnover

**Project Risks**:
6. **Project Quality**: Not all renewable projects succeed
7. **Market Risk**: Energy prices affect project returns
8. **Construction**: Delays and cost overruns possible
9. **Regulatory**: Project-level permits and compliance

### How are you mitigating these risks?

- **Regulatory**: Working with specialized legal counsel from day 1
- **Market**: Extensive validation through pre-launch outreach
- **Technology**: Using proven tech stack, experienced developers
- **Competition**: First-mover speed, community focus, mission alignment
- **Team**: Competitive packages, equity, mission-driven culture
- **Projects**: Multi-stage due diligence, diversification, insurance

### What if you can't raise the full amount?

We can launch with minimum $750K:
- Focus on web platform only (delay mobile)
- Smaller initial team (2 vs 3 hires)
- Fewer pilot projects (3 vs 5)
- Longer timeline to Series A (24 vs 18 months)

We've structured the budget with flexibility.

### What if the platform doesn't gain traction?

Pivot options:
1. **B2B Focus**: White-label platform for project developers
2. **Consulting**: Energy project advisory services
3. **Data**: Sell market intelligence on renewable projects
4. **Acquisition**: Sell platform tech to larger player

But we're confident in market demand based on research and early interest.

### What happens to my investment if you fail?

Honest answer: With startups, there's risk of total loss. That's why we:
- Are transparent about challenges
- Focus on capital-efficient growth
- Target proven project types initially
- Have experienced advisors
- Maintain investor communication

But yes - only invest what you can afford to lose.
