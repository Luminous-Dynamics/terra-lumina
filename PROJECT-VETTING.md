# Terra Lumina Project Vetting Framework
## Renewable Energy Project Due Diligence & Approval Process

> **Version**: 1.0
> **Last Updated**: January 2025
> **Owner**: Head of Projects
> **Review Cadence**: Quarterly

---

## Overview

This framework establishes the systematic process for evaluating, scoring, and approving renewable energy projects for listing on the Terra Lumina platform. Our goal: Fund only high-quality projects that deliver strong returns while advancing the clean energy transition.

### Guiding Principles

**1. Quality Over Quantity**
- Reject 40%+ of submitted projects
- Maintain high standards for investor protection
- Build reputation through project success

**2. Conservative Projections**
- Require 20% margin of safety in all financial models
- Stress test against worst-case scenarios
- Under-promise and over-deliver

**3. Community Benefit**
- Prioritize projects with local ownership pathways
- Ensure community engagement and support
- Avoid extractive or exploitative structures

**4. Transparency**
- Document all approval/rejection decisions
- Share rationale with developers
- Continuous improvement based on outcomes

---
