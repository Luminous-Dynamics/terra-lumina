Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for considering Terra Lumina and for the time you invested in our due diligence process.

While I'm disappointed we won't be working together at this stage, I completely understand that [their reason / timing / fit] makes sense for your portfolio.

I'd love to keep you in the loop for our Series A (targeting 18-24 months) if you're open to it. We'll be in a very different place by then with:
- Live platform and proven traction
- 20+ funded projects
- Strong unit economics
- Clear path to profitability

**Stay Connected:**
- Monthly newsletter: [signup link]
- Series A notification list: [link]
- LinkedIn: [your profile]

Thank you again for your consideration. I hope our paths cross again!

Best wishes,
[Your Name]
Terra Lumina

P.S. If anything changes or you'd like to discuss advisory/smaller involvement, my door is always open.
