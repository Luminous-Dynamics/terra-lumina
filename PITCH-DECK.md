### Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual**: Split image - locked institutional investment vs. concerned retail investor

**Headline**: The Clean Energy Investment Paradox

**Key Points:**
1. **$2.3 Trillion needed** annually for renewable energy transition (IEA)
2. **87,000 untapped dams** in the US alone could power 12M homes
3. **Retail investors locked out** - minimum investments start at $250K-$1M
4. **Communities want ownership** but have no path to invest locally

**Bottom Quote**: *"We have the projects. We have the capital. But they can't find each other."*

**Speaker Notes:**
- "The clean energy transition requires trillions in capital"
- "There are 87,000 existing dams in the US that could be converted to generate power - that's a $60B opportunity sitting untapped"
- "Meanwhile, millions of people want to invest in renewable energy, but they're locked out. Minimums are $250K+, only for accredited investors"
- "Communities watch outside investors profit from local energy infrastructure"
- Pause for impact: "We're solving this."

### Slide 3: The Solution

**Visual**: Platform screenshot mockup showing project listings

**Headline**: Terra Lumina - The Renewable Energy Investment Platform

**Key Points:**
1. **Terra Atlas Platform**: Digital marketplace connecting investors to projects
2. **Invest from $10 to $10M**: Democratizing access for all investors
3. **Curated Projects**: We vet every renewable energy project (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal)
4. **Community Ownership Path**: 7-year transition to local ownership

**Bottom Stat**: *Platform target: $1.8B investment volume by Year 5*

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Terra Lumina is a platform - think Fundrise meets renewable energy"
- "We curate high-quality renewable energy projects, handle all the legal complexity, and make them investable"
- "Anyone can invest, from $10 to $10 million. SEC-compliant, using Regulation Crowdfunding"
- "Unique differentiator: We have a 7-year path where projects transition to community ownership. Investors make returns, communities gain ownership."
- "This aligns profit with purpose."

### Slide 4: How It Works

**Visual**: Flow diagram with 4 steps

**Headline**: Simple for Investors, Seamless for Developers

**Investor Journey:**
1. **Browse Projects** → Curated renewable energy opportunities
2. **Invest Securely** → From $10, SEC-compliant, simple process
3. **Track Returns** → Real-time dashboard, quarterly distributions
4. **Community Exit** → 7-year path to local ownership (or earlier liquidity)

**Developer Journey:**
1. **Submit Project** → Free listing, rigorous due diligence
2. **Fundraise** → Access to thousands of investors
3. **Build & Operate** → Milestone-based fund releases
4. **Generate Returns** → Revenue sharing with investors

**Speaker Notes:**
- "For investors: Browse projects like browsing real estate on Fundrise. Click, invest, done."
- "We handle all the paperwork - investment agreements, regulatory compliance, tax documents"
- "For developers: Submit your project, we do the due diligence, you get access to capital"
- "It's marketplace dynamics - we make money when projects fund successfully"

### Slide 5: Market Opportunity

**Visual**: Concentric circles showing TAM, SAM, SOM

**Headline**: $180B Serviceable Market, Massive Tailwinds

**Market Sizing:**
- **TAM**: $2.3T global renewable investment needed annually
- **SAM**: $180B US retrofit & community renewable projects
- **SOM**: $1.8B platform volume by Year 5 (1% of SAM)

**Market Drivers:**
1. **Climate Urgency**: Net-zero commitments require massive capital deployment
2. **Retail Investment Boom**: 18M+ new retail investors since 2020
3. **Regulatory Tailwinds**: IRA tax credits, state mandates
4. **Democratization Trend**: Crowdfunding grew from $2.7B → $13.9B (2016-2022)

**Speaker Notes:**
- "The market is enormous. $2.3 trillion needed annually for renewable transition"
- "Our focus: the $180 billion in US retrofit and community projects - existing dams, rooftops, wind sites"
- "We're targeting 1% of that market by Year 5 - conservative given first-mover advantage"
- "Four major tailwinds: climate urgency, retail investment boom, government incentives, and crowdfunding going mainstream"
- "This is a perfect storm of opportunity."

### Slide 6: Business Model

**Visual**: Revenue flow diagram

**Headline**: Capital-Efficient Marketplace with Recurring Revenue

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **Platform Fees**: 2.5% of investment amount (paid by investors)
2. **Success Fees**: 1% annually on project returns (paid by projects)
3. **Premium Services**: Data room access, analytics, white-label (10% of revenue)
4. **Partnerships**: Financial institution referrals (5% of revenue)

**Unit Economics:**
- Average investment: $7,500
- Platform fee: $187.50 per investment
- Success fees (5 years): $375
- **LTV per investor: $1,800**
- **CAC: $2,500 (Y1) → $500 (Y3)**
- **LTV:CAC ratio: 3.6:1 by Year 3**

**Why This Works:**
- High gross margins (85%+)
- Recurring revenue from success fees
- Network effects (more projects attract more investors)
- Scalable software platform

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We're a marketplace, so we make money when transactions happen"
- "Platform fee: 2.5% - lower than Fundrise (3-5%), competitive with real estate crowdfunding"
- "Success fee: 1% annually - aligns our incentives with investor success"
- "Unit economics are strong: $1,800 lifetime value, CAC starts at $2,500 but drops to $500"
- "By Year 3, we're at 3.6:1 LTV:CAC - that's excellent for a marketplace"
- "85%+ gross margins because it's software at scale"

        │
        │   TERRA LUMINA ⭐
        │   (Infrastructure + Community)
        │
        │                   Private Equity/VC
        │                   (Accredited only)
────────┼────────────────────────────────────
        │   Green Bonds        Fundrise
        │   (Low returns)      (Real Estate)
        │
        │   Mosaic             Abundance
        │   (Solar loans)      (UK only)
Low Returns (4-6%)
        │
    Limited Access ←→ Broad Access
```

**Key Competitors:**
- **Mosaic**: Solar loans (4-6% returns), residential focus, no equity
- **Abundance**: UK renewable bonds (4-8% returns), not US accessible
- **Fundrise**: Real estate crowdfunding, could expand to renewables
- **Traditional Finance**: VC/PE, $10M+ minimums, accredited only

**Our Advantages:**
1. **First-Mover**: No direct competitor in US renewable infrastructure crowdfunding
2. **Higher Returns**: 11-14% IRR target vs. 4-6% for debt instruments
3. **Community Model**: Only platform with ownership transition path
4. **Data Advantage**: Proprietary 87K dam database

**Speaker Notes:**
- "There's no one doing exactly what we're doing. We're in a blue ocean."
- "Mosaic does solar loans - different model, lower returns, no community ownership"
- "Abundance is great but UK-only, and it's debt not equity"
- "Fundrise is the risk - they could expand into renewables. But we have a head start and vertical expertise"
- "Traditional finance serves institutions. We're democratizing access."
- Point to matrix: "We're in the sweet spot - high returns AND broad accessibility"

## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why will investors use your platform vs. just buying renewable energy ETFs?**
A: Three reasons: (1) Direct ownership with higher returns (11-14% vs. market-correlated), (2) Community connection and impact, (3) Path to local ownership. ETFs give you exposure; we give you ownership.

**Q: What if Fundrise decides to do renewable energy tomorrow?**
A: We welcome it - validates the market. But we have advantages: (1) First-mover and speed, (2) Vertical expertise in energy, (3) Proprietary data (87K dam database), (4) Community ownership model (unique differentiator). We're building deep moats fast.

**Q: How do you vet projects? What if they fail?**
A: Rigorous 3-stage process: (1) Financial analysis (cash flows, IRR, risk), (2) Technical review (engineering, permits, viability), (3) Legal compliance (ownership, contracts). We reject 40% of submitted projects. We use conservative projections. We diversify. Some will underperform - we're transparent about that. But the portfolio will deliver.

**Q: What's your regulatory risk?**
A: Moderate. We've built for multiple frameworks (Reg CF, D, A+) so we're not dependent on one. We over-comply to buffer against changes. We have a 6-month legal reserve. We're proactively engaging regulators. This is our top risk, and we're managing it aggressively.

**Q: Why do you need $1.2M? Seems like a lot for a marketplace.**
A: Securities compliance is expensive. We need lawyers, audits, and regulatory infrastructure from day one. We need a secure, compliant platform - can't cut corners. And we're hiring a world-class team. 37% goes to team, 25% to platform, 15% to legal. This isn't a consumer app - this is regulated financial infrastructure.

**Q: What's your exit strategy?**
A: Three paths: (1) IPO in 5-7 years (most likely), (2) Strategic acquisition by financial institution or energy company, (3) Long-term independent profitable company. We're building to last, but we'll create liquidity opportunities for early investors.

**Q: How are you different from community solar programs?**
A: Community solar is a subscription - you get electricity credits, not ownership or returns. We offer investment ownership with financial returns AND the path to community ownership. Completely different value proposition.

**Q: What's your unfair advantage?**
A: Four things: (1) First-mover in this specific niche, (2) Proprietary database of 87K untapped dams, (3) Community ownership model (no one else has this), (4) Timing - perfect storm of climate urgency, retail investment boom, and policy support.

**Q: Why hasn't someone done this already?**
A: Great question. Regulation Crowdfunding only matured in last 5 years. Real estate crowdfunding proved the model. Renewable energy tech only recently became cost-competitive. The perfect storm is recent. We're here at exactly the right time.

**Q: What keeps you up at night?**
A: Honestly? Execution speed. The market window is open NOW. If we move too slowly, a well-funded competitor could enter. That's why we're raising quickly, hiring aggressively, and launching fast. Speed is our edge.

**Q: How much are you taking in salary?**
A: [Be transparent - e.g., "$80K founder salary, market rate once we hit Series A. This is about building, not getting rich on salary."]

**Q: What happens if this Pre-Seed round is over-subscribed?**
A: We cap at $1.5M for this round. If we're oversubscribed, we'll create a waitlist for the first follow-on round (bridge or Series A). We want the right investors, not just the most capital.

**Q: Who are your dream investors for this round?**
A: People who bring more than capital: (1) Climate tech operators who've scaled platforms, (2) Renewable energy industry connections, (3) Regulatory/legal expertise, (4) Marketing/community building experience. If you bring strategic value, let's talk.
