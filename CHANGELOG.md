## Migration Notes

### Pre-Seed Platform Model (Current)
Terra Lumina is now positioned as a **Pre-Seed platform** seeking $750K-1.5M to build infrastructure connecting investors to renewable energy projects globally. The platform focuses on democratizing energy investment.

### Previous Concept (Deprecated)
Earlier versions described a $650M Series D fundraise for building geothermal cities in Iceland. This concept has been replaced with the platform model approach.
