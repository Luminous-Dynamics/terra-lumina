## Metrics Framework Overview

### Metrics Philosophy

**Purpose-Driven**: Every metric must serve a clear business decision or goal.

**Actionable**: Metrics we can influence through our actions, not just vanity metrics.

**Leading + Lagging**: Balance of predictive indicators and outcome measures.

**Transparent**: Shared openly with team, investors, and community (where appropriate).
