**FinCEN SAR Template**:
1. **Subject Information**: Name, DOB, SSN/TIN, address
2. **Suspicious Activity**: Date, amount, type
3. **Narrative**: Describe suspicious activity, red flags, investigation steps
4. **Supporting Documentation**: Reference transaction IDs, account records

**Narrative Example**:
> "On [date], customer [name] (DOB [date], SSN [xxx-xx-xxxx]) opened an account and made three deposits totaling $9,500 each over three consecutive days ($28,500 total), each slightly below the $10,000 CTR threshold. Customer stated purpose was 'investment,' but provided vague responses when asked about source of funds. Customer has no prior investment history with our platform. Enhanced due diligence conducted: [describe steps]. This pattern is consistent with structuring to avoid CTR reporting. SAR filed in accordance with 31 CFR 1022.320."
