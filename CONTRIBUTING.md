# Contributing to Luminous Dynamics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our consciousness-first technology ecosystem! üåü

## Our Philosophy

We believe technology should amplify human consciousness, not fragment it. Every contribution, whether code, documentation, or ideas, helps us build more humane and accessible technology.

## How to Contribute

### üêõ Reporting Issues

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use issue templates when available
3. Provide clear reproduction steps
4. Include system information when relevant

### üí° Suggesting Features

1. Open a discussion first for major features
2. Explain the problem your feature solves
3. Consider how it aligns with our consciousness-first principles
4. Be open to alternative approaches

### üîß Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes following our code style
4. Write or update tests as needed
5. Update documentation if required

#### Commit Messages

We use conventional commits:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add natural language search to package discovery`

#### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update the README.md if needed
3. Add your changes to CHANGELOG.md (if present)
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Be responsive to feedback
6. Celebrate when merged! üéâ

### üìö Documentation

Documentation contributions are highly valued! This includes:
- Fixing typos or clarity issues
- Adding examples
- Translating documentation
- Creating tutorials

## Development Setup

Each project has specific setup instructions in its README. Generally:

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME
cd REPO-NAME

# Install dependencies (varies by project)
npm install  # For Node.js projects
poetry install  # For Python projects
cargo build  # For Rust projects

# Run tests
npm test  # or
pytest  # or
cargo test
```

## Code Style

### General Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Write code that's easy to understand
- **Document why, not what**: Comments should explain reasoning
- **Test your changes**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Keep it simple**: Avoid over-engineering

### Language-Specific

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Prefer functional approaches
- Use meaningful variable names

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and small

**Rust:**
- Follow standard Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- Write safe code by default
- Document public APIs

## Community Guidelines

### Sacred Principles
- **Respect all beings**: Every contributor is valued
- **Patience with learning**: We all started somewhere
- **Constructive feedback**: Focus on improving the work
- **Celebrate diversity**: Different perspectives strengthen us

### Code of Conduct
- Be welcoming and inclusive
- Respect differing viewpoints
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Show empathy toward others

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized in:
- Project README files
- Release notes
- Our contributor hall of fame (coming soon)

## Questions?

- Open a discussion in the repository
- Email: contribute@luminousdynamics.org
- Join our community channels (Discord coming soon)

## Sacred Development

Remember: Every line of code is an opportunity to serve consciousness. We're not just building software; we're crafting tools that honor human awareness and potential.
