2. Could result in material financial loss or legal liability
3. Requires urgent response with high stakes
4. Has potential for negative media coverage or reputational damage
5. Disrupts normal business operations

### Guiding Principles

**Transparency First**: Be honest, direct, and timely in all communications

**Stakeholder Protection**: Prioritize investor and customer safety and interests

**Rapid Response**: Acknowledge within 1 hour, full response within 24 hours

**Unified Voice**: Single source of truth, no conflicting messages

**Learn & Improve**: Every crisis is an opportunity to strengthen
